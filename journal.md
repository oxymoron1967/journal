Friday 1.31 8:00 9:30
Played with pwd, cd, ls
Tried doing it without at first. Disaster.
Things I learned:
Just typing "cd" with no dots after it will take me to the top directory. 
Folders are not case sensitive
If you create a folder with two words, you have to put it in single quotes 
OR else the error message "too many arguments" pops up. 
Saturday 2.1 7:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30
Reviewed pwd, cd, ls
Worked with touch, echo, mv, mkdir
Discovered you can't use spaces when creating file names
That creates two files. Only one will be a text file.
Discovered that if you leave out the slash, mv renames files. 
When movng files, I managed to lose a few. 
This was incedibly frustrating. Took a break.
Figured out that this happened when I tried to move a file up or down more than one directory. 
Not sure if this is why that happened of it's coincidence. 
Took a break
Went back, Discovered that after I create a new directory, sometimes I can move things there, sometimes I can't.
Sunday 1-2:30
Still spent time trying to figure out where fikles were going when they disappeared. 
Never figured it out 

Journal2: A long day's journey into frsutration
Worked all afternoon Sunday 2/16
I realized that I should have done at least something earlier in the week, as I forgot A LOT. 
Made my first journal entry, then realized that, when I saved it, I misspelled "journal", so I deleted and redid it. 
I used git add, but failed with git commit. I think I forgot to include a messgae but when I tried to do that, I failed again. 
I work on a lot of things from DHRI command line tutorial, including pipes, the sort function, echo, head, tail, etc. 
Accidentally types in "Sc" and got a solid wall of text explaining what that function was. I understood pretty much none of it. 
LEarned the tab and clear text commands. 
Played with wc, including wc -l (for line count) and wc -m (for characters)
ALso worked with uniq and grep, using both the data file they provided and one I had from a previous research project. 
I can't say that I'm totally comfortable with all of this, but I think, I understand it. I need to take an entire weekend, lock myself in my apartment and just work on all of these things.
