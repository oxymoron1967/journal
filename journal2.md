Friday 1.31 8:00 9:30
Played with pwd, cd, ls
Tried doing it without at first. Disaster.
Things I learned:
Just typing "cd" with no dots after it will take me to the top directory. 
Folders are not case sensitive
If you create a folder with two words, you have to put it in single quotes 
OR else the error message "too many arguments" pops up. 
Saturday 2.1 7:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30
Reviewed pwd, cd, ls
Worked with touch, echo, mv, mkdir
Discovered you can't use spaces when creating file names
That creates two files. Only one will be a text file.
Discovered that if you leave out the slash, mv renames files. 
When movng files, I managed to lose a few. 
This was incedibly frustrating. Took a break.
Figured out that this happened when I tried to move a file up or down more than one directory. 
Not sure if this is why that happened of it's coincidence. 
Took a break
Went back, Discovered that after I create a new directory, sometimes I can move things there, sometimes I can't.
Sunday 1-2:30
Still spent time trying to figure out where fikles were going when they disappeared. 
Never figured it out 

Journal2: A long day's journey into frsutration
Worked all afternoon Sunday 2/16
I realized that I should have done at least something earlier in the week, as I forgot A LOT. 
Made my first journal entry, then realized that, when I saved it, I misspelled "journal", so I deleted and redid it. 
I used git add, but failed with git commit. I think I forgot to include a messgae but when I tried to do that, I failed again. 
I work on a lot of things from DHRI command line tutorial, including pipes, the sort function, echo, head, tail, etc. 
Accidentally types in "Sc" and got a solid wall of text explaining what that function was. I understood pretty much none of it. 
LEarned the tab and clear text commands. 
Played with wc, including wc -l (for line count) and wc -m (for characters)
ALso worked with uniq and grep, using both the data file they provided and one I had from a previous research project. 
I can't say that I'm totally comfortable with all of this, but I think, I understand it. I need to take an entire weekend, lock myself in my apartment and just work on all of these things. 

Journal three
I deleted and uploaded anaconda at least three times, and could not get it to run. 
So, I decided to push my journal, but I couldn't do that. 

AFter several fustrating tries (and much colorful language) with both of these, I decided to review some basic commands. 

Journal four
Python is successfully uploaded and managed to push my journal.

I expanded our little weather program and worked on python

Journal four
Started with Kahn Academy's HTML course
Learned about tags like <p>, headeers, titles, line breaks, body etc.
Wrote a poem in HTML and saved it.
Learned about tags for emphasis like em and strong
Also did lists using ul and li -- for bullet points
ol and li for numbered lists -- made one of my favorite museums and exhibits

Journal five
Played with museums lists I made. Changed the museums I belong to to a numbered list, and the favorite exhibition to a non-numbered list. 
Added an image to webpage with img and src and alt and width and height This was much more diofficult than I thought it would be. I'm not sure why. I got so frsutrated that I had to get up and walk away for a while. When I came back, it worked. I think maybe that I put the image tag before the body tag, and then I moved it (because I moved it two or three times), it worked. 
Added links for all the exhibitions, so if you click on them it takes you to that exhibit's webpage.
Started the process of turning this into the main page, with each of the museums getting its own page. 
May change my final; project into building this.  

Journal six

set up an entry page, with a list of the museums I belong to. Each one of those entries links to the my webpage about the museum. 

Set up each individual musuem page, complete with a link to the museum's main webpage. I also listed some of my favorite exhibits one each museum page, along with the links to those exhibits. 

Added a link at the bottom of each individual musuem page to go back to the main page. 

Visual Studio Code was a huge help here: it completed the tags and I could tell when I made a mistake, so I could fix it. 

I made a kind of template for the individual webpages, which made it easier, though it still took more time than I thought it would. This didn't eliminate mistakes, because, God knows I made a lot, but it makes it easier to track them down. 

Next up: add photos to all the museum pages. I'm going to pull them from wikimedia commons if I can.

Journal 7

Added photos to all the museum pages. Photos came from wikimedia commons, which provides the coding necessary. That made things easier. Of course, it took me a while to figure it out. 

Added blurbs about some of the museums. 

Journal 8

Finished adding the blurbs, then went back and proofread things. I probably didn't catch every mistake, but I got some. 

Tested the links to make sure they all work.

Journal 9

Worked on CSS via KHan Academy, tested all the things they discussed on the museums webpages. I decided most of them didn't matter for what I was doing, but did keeo some color changes. 

Worked on more html tags with Khan Academy, testing stuff out and keeping what I thought was necessary for the project. Uploaded new ersion fo the project and this to github.

4/25 
I fought with python and python won. Will go through the learn python the hard way tutorials again tomorrow or next week. Not now. Too damned frustrated. 

So... worked with HTML to build a website to host my CV. Didn't finish this, but I started

4/27 

Worked more with HTML and CSS for the museum website and the CV website. Not sure where to host these things, though. 

Went over the command line stuff again, because I needed to review it. 

5/2

More work on the CV. 

Tried to use flask on my own, didn;t work well. 

5/5

More work on CV, proofed the musuem wesite. (Will do that again) MAy add a recording to the museum website. 

5/9

Went back to python. May just have to pay for the learn pythoin the hard way thing because it usually makes sens in class, but doesn;t when I play with it on my own.
